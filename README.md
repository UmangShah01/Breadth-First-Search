# Breadth First Search Using Python
# What is Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search (BFS) is used to traverse a graph or a tree it can be explored by root node or any arbitary node 
and it is traversed level-wise that means all the nodes at the same level will be traversed then the nodes at the next
level will be traversed.

**Note: The BFS travse level vise, ie it means it completes one level and then searches for the GOAL at the next level untill it reaches the goal or it does not find the goal element** 

# Procedure
1. First you start from root node
2. Then traverse all the neighbouring nodes at the same level
3. Do the same until the last level
4. Stop
