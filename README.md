# Breadth First Search Using Python
# What is Breadth First Search

Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from root node and explores all the neighbouring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explore all the unexplored nodes. 
The algorithm follows the same process for each of the nearest node until it finds the goal.

# Procedure to Implement It in program
  * **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited node. Mark it as visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.
  * **Rule 2** − If no adjacent node is found, remove the first node from the queue.
  * **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is empty.

### **The Breadth first search for below Tree is 2,0,3,1**
